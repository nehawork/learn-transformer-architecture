### 🧠 What Are Token Embeddings?

When we use words in AI or machine learning, we can’t feed text directly into models. Instead, we convert each **word (or token)** into **a list of numbers** — that’s called an **embedding**.

Think of it like this:

* Each word becomes a **dot in space**, and similar words are **closer together**.

### 1. 🎨 Simple 2D Example (with made-up numbers)

Let’s create a pretend world with just 2 properties: **Gender** and **Age**.

| Word  | Gender (0 = Male, 1 = Female) | Age (0 = Young, 1 = Adult) |
| ----- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| boy   | 0                             | 0                          |
| girl  | 1                             | 0                          |
| man   | 0                             | 1                          |
| woman | 1                             | 1                          |

So, we can represent each word like a **vector** (just a list of numbers):

* `boy` = \[0, 0]
* `girl` = \[1, 0]
* `man` = \[0, 1]
* `woman` = \[1, 1]

✅ You can *see* the logic:

* "boy" and "man" are similar (both male).
* "girl" and "woman" are similar (both female).
* "girl" and "boy" are close in age.
* "woman" and "man" are adults.

### 2. ➕ Vector Math: Word Analogies

Here’s a fun trick with embeddings:

🧠 "man is to woman as king is to \_\_\_\_?"

Let’s assign:

* `man` = \[1, 0, 0]
* `woman` = \[0, 1, 0]
* `king` = \[1, 0, 1]
* `queen` = \[0, 1, 1]

Now we do:

```
king - man + woman = ?
[1, 0, 1] - [1, 0, 0] + [0, 1, 0] = [0, 1, 1] = queen
```

🤯 So cool! You can do **math with meanings**!

### 3. 🏋️‍♂️ How Do We Learn These Numbers?

We don’t manually write them. A computer **learns** them by reading huge amounts of text, like:

> "The cat sat on the mat. The dog chased the cat."

If a word appears often with other words, their embeddings move **closer** together.

---

### 4. 🛠️ Skip-Gram with Negative Sampling (SGNS)

This is a training technique:

* For each word in a sentence, we look at its **neighboring words** (context).
* If "dog" appears next to "chased", we say “YES, they go together.”
* We randomly pick unrelated words like "banana" and say “NO, they don’t go together.”
* Model learns from this — pushing good pairs closer and bad pairs apart.

🔁 Repeat for millions of words = smart embeddings!

---

### 5. 🧩 Real Use: GPT and BERT

The AI you’re using now (like ChatGPT) **starts with embeddings**.
They help the model understand:

* What words mean
* How they relate
* What to expect next

### ✅ Summary for You

| Concept    | What it means                      | Easy Example                       |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Token      | A word or part of a word           | "man", "king", "run"               |
| Embedding  | A vector representing a token      | `man = [1, 0, 0]`                  |
| Similarity | Words close in meaning are closer  | `man` \~ `boy`, `queen` \~ `woman` |
| Analogy    | Do math with meanings              | `king - man + woman = queen`       |
| Learning   | Based on how words appear together | "cat" near "mat" → related         |
