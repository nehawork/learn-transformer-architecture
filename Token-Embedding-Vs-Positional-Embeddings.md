Understanding the difference between **embeddings** and **positional embeddings** is key to grasping how transformer models (like GPT, BERT, etc.) understand language.

---

### 🧠 1. **Token Embeddings** (aka "word embeddings")

These represent the **meaning** of a token (word or subword) as a vector.

* 🟢 Created using an **embedding layer** in the model.
* 🔢 Example: `"cat"` → `[0.25, -0.13, ..., 0.56]` (size e.g., 768 or 4096)
* 💡 Purpose: Capture **semantic** meaning — similar words have similar vectors.

> Think: "What does this word mean?"

---

### 🧭 2. **Positional Embeddings**

These represent the **position** of each token in the sentence.

* 🟡 Added to token embeddings because transformers have **no sense of order** (they don’t process data sequentially like RNNs).
* 🔢 Example: 1st position → `[0.01, 0.03, ..., -0.02]`, 2nd → `[0.05, -0.01, ..., 0.06]`
* 💡 Purpose: Tell the model **where** each token is in the sequence.

> Think: "Where is this word in the sentence?"

### 📌 How are they used together?

In transformer models:

```python
final_embedding = token_embedding + positional_embedding
```

This combined vector is then passed to the attention layers.

### 📐 Example

Sentence: `"I love AI"`

| Token    | Token Embedding (semantic) | Positional Embedding (position info) |
| -------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `"I"`    | `[0.12, 0.88, ..., 0.34]`  | `[0.01, -0.02, ..., 0.05]`           |
| `"love"` | `[0.45, 0.66, ..., 0.78]`  | `[0.02, -0.01, ..., 0.03]`           |
| `"AI"`   | `[0.91, 0.22, ..., 0.11]`  | `[0.03, -0.04, ..., 0.07]`           |

### 🔍 What is **Position Encoding**?

**Position encoding** (or **positional encoding**) is **how transformers inject information about the position of tokens** into the model — since they don’t inherently understand sequence order like RNNs or LSTMs.


### 🎯 Example in Code (PyTorch-style):

```python
# Token embedding
token_embeddings = embedding_layer(input_ids)  # shape: [batch_size, seq_len, embed_dim]

# Positional encoding (learned or fixed)
position_embeddings = position_encoding_layer(seq_len)  # shape: [1, seq_len, embed_dim]

# Final input to transformer
input = token_embeddings + position_embeddings
```

### Term Definition

| Term                     | Definition                                                                      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Token Embedding**      | Vector representing the **meaning** of the word/token                           |
| **Positional Embedding** | Vector representing the **position** of the token in the sequence               |
| **Positional Encoding**  | General term for the method used to add position info (can be fixed or learned) |

> 🔄 So **"positional encoding"** is the technique, and **"positional embeddings"** are usually the resulting vectors.
