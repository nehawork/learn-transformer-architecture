## 💡 Imagine You’re Reading a Sentence

Let’s say we have this sentence:

**"The cat sat on the mat."**

It has **tokens**:

```
["The", "cat", "sat", "on", "the", "mat", "."]
```

---

## 🧱 Step-by-Step Breakdown (Simple Terms)

### 1. 🎟️ **Tokens**

Each word is broken into tokens. In this case, we assume each word is one token.

---

### 2. 🔢 **Token Embeddings**

Each token is converted into a **vector of numbers** (its **meaning**).

> Example:

```
"cat" → [0.3, -0.8, 0.1, ..., 0.5]  (say, 4096 dimensions)
```

These embeddings help the model understand **what** the word means.

---

### 3. 📍 **Positional Embeddings**

Because the model doesn’t know word order, we add a vector for each **position**.

> Example:

```
2nd word ("cat") → position 1 → [0.01, -0.04, ..., 0.09]
```

This tells the model **where** each word is in the sentence.

---

### 4. ➕ Add Them Together

Final input =
`Token Embedding + Position Embedding`

Now the model knows both:

* What the word means
* Where it is in the sentence

---

### 5. 🧠 **Attention Block: The Core Idea**

Now comes the **attention block** — the heart of the transformer.

#### 🧠 It asks:

> “Which other words should this word focus on to understand the sentence better?”

Example:

* When the model is looking at **"sat"**, it may attend to **"cat"** (who is sitting).
* When it looks at **"mat"**, it may also attend to **"on"** and **"sat"** to understand its role.

This is done by:

* Comparing all tokens to each other
* Calculating attention scores (how much one word should “pay attention to” another)
* Creating a **weighted average** of other token vectors

So each token gets **enriched** with information from the rest of the sentence!

---

### 6. 🎯 After Attention: Feed Forward Network

Once tokens “talk to” each other:

* A mini neural network transforms each token’s vector
* It adds more patterns/meaning

---

### ✅ Final Output

Now each token’s final vector contains:

* Its **own meaning**
* **Where** it is
* **What it learned** from other words

---

## 🔁 This is One Attention Block

In reality, transformers use **many of these blocks stacked** to build deeper understanding.

## 📌 Summary (in super simple terms):

| Concept              | Meaning                                                                               |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Token                | A word or part of a word (e.g. "cat")                                                 |
| Token Embedding      | A vector that says what the word means                                                |
| Positional Embedding | A vector that says where the word is                                                  |
| Attention Block      | A smart layer that lets each word look at others and update its meaning based on them |
